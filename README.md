# File Renaming Script

## Overview

This Python script simplifies the process of renaming and organizing image files within a directory. Developed to streamline everyday tasks, it offers functionalities to rename files with sequential numbering and move them to a specified destination.

## Features

- Rename and Move Files: Rename image files with a user-defined name and sequential numbering, then relocate them to a designated destination folder.
- Configurable Directory and Destination: Easily change the working directory and destination folder through simple user prompts.
- User-Friendly Menu: Intuitive menu system for easy navigation and execution of tasks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-renaming-script.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd file-renaming-script
```

3. Run the script.
```bash
python file_renamer.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform desired actions such as renaming files, changing the directory, or changing the destination.

## Configuration

- The script utilizes a configuration file (config.txt) to store the directory and destination paths. Ensure the config.txt file is present in the project directory.
- Modify the configuration file directly if needed, or use the script's menu options to change directory or destination interactively.
